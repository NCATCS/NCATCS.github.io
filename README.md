#Welcome to the code behind NC A&T's open-source [GEEN 165 Resource site](https://ncandtcs.github.io).

##What is open source?
Open-source is a term used to describe any program, website, or other project where the source code for that project is publicly available. GitHub hosts the largest collection of open source projects in the world.

##Why open source?
It may seem counter-intuitive that large software companies would reveal the code that makes their products run. Why, you might ask, would you want to give away the code that supports your business?

The short answer is that open-source software is good for the community that develops it and for the community that uses it. The long answer is a bit more complicated:

* Open source software can solve problem's the developer never even heard of.
