#Welcome to the code behind NC A&T's open-source [GEEN-165 Resource site](https://ncandtcs.github.io).

##What is open source?
Open-source is a term used to describe any program, website, or other project where the source code for that project is publicly available. GitHub hosts the largest collection of open source projects in the world.

##Why open source?
It may seem counter-intuitive that large software companies would reveal the code that makes their products run. Why, you might ask, would you want to give away the code that supports your business?

The short answer is that open-source software is good for the community that develops it and for the community that uses it. The long answer is a bit more complicated:

* Open source software can expand beyond the ability of the original developer.
   * Many open source projects are started by a single developer. In order for these projects to grow to their full potential, they requre many more developers assisting in solving problems. Open-source allows anyone who finds the project valuable to contribute to development.
* Open source software earns higher trust from those who use it.
   * Trust is important for a large number of software uses. For example, [AESCrypt](www.aescrypt.com) is an open source encryption utility available across all major platforms. For something as important as Advanced Encryption Standard security, users only want to use software they can trust. By being open source, AESCrypt allows users to inspect their software and ensure that no security liabilities are present in the product they are using.
